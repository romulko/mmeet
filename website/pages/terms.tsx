                    jurisdiction (for example, you do not appear on the U.S.
                    Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals

                solely responsible for all activities that occur under those

            <p>4. Modifying the Service and Termination.</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                mmeet is always striving to improve the Service and bring you
                additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful.
                This means we may add new product features or enhancements from
                time to time as well as remove some features, and if these
                actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we
                may not provide you with notice before taking them. We may even
                suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will notify you
                in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or
                security concerns, prevent us from doing so.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by
                following the instructions in &quot;Settings&quot; in the
                Service.{' '}
                {/*However, if you use a third party payment account such
                as Apple’s App Store or iTunes Store, as applicable (“App
                Store”) or the Google Play Store, you will need to manage in app
                purchases through such an account to avoid additional billing.*/}
                mmeet may terminate your account at any time without notice if
                it believes that you have violated this Agreement.{' '}
                {/*Upon such
                termination, you will not be entitled to any refund for
                purchases.*/}
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                For residents of the Republic of Korea, except in the case where
                we reasonably consider that (i) giving notice is legally
                prohibited (for instance, when providing notice would either
                violate applicable laws, regulations, or orders from regulatory
                authorities or compromise an ongoing investigation conducted by
                a regulatory authority) or (ii) any notice may cause harm to
                you, third parties, mmeet, and/or our affiliates (for instance,
                when providing notice harms the security of the Service), we
                will without delay notify you of the reason for taking the
                relevant step.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                After your account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate,
                except that the following provisions will still apply to you and
                mmeet: Section 4, Section 5, and Sections 12 through 19.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>5. Safety; Your Interactions with Other Members.</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                Though mmeet strives to encourage a respectful member experience
                through features like the double opt-in that allows members to
                communicate only after they have both indicated interest in one
                another, mmeet is not responsible for the conduct of any member
                on or off of the Service. You agree to use caution in all
                interactions with other members, particularly if you decide to
                communicate off the Service or meet in person. You agree that
                you will not provide your financial information (for example,
                your credit card or bank account information), or wire or
                otherwise send money to other members.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER
                MEMBERS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MMEET DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL
                BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS MEMBERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE
                BACKGROUND OF ITS MEMBERS. MMEET MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
                WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OR COMPATIBILITY OF MEMBERS.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>6. Rights mmeet Grants You.</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                mmeet grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free,

            <p>7. Rights you Grant mmeet.</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                By creating an account, you grant to mmeet a worldwide,
                transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, right and license to
                host, store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit,
                publish, modify and distribute information you authorize us to
                access from third parties such as Google, as well as any
                information you post, upload, display or otherwise make
                available (collectively, &quot;post&quot;) on the Service or
                transmit to other members (collectively, &quot;Content&quot;).
                mmeet&apos;s license to your Content shall be non-exclusive,
                except that mmeet&apos;s license shall be exclusive with respect
                to derivative works created through use of the Service. For
                example, mmeet would have an exclusive license to screenshots of
                the Service that include your Content. In addition, so that
                mmeet can prevent the use of your Content outside of the
                Service, you authorize mmeet to act on your behalf with respect
                to infringing uses of your Content taken from the Service by
                other members or third parties. This expressly includes the
                authority, but not the obligation, to send notices pursuant to
                17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices) on your
                behalf if your Content is taken and used by third parties
                outside of the Service. Our license to your Content is subject
                to your rights under applicable law (for example laws regarding
                personal data protection to the extent any Content contains
                personal information as defined by those laws) and is for the
                limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, and
                improving the Service and researching and developing new ones.
                You agree that any Content you place or that you authorize us to
                place on the Service may be viewed by other members and may be
                viewed by any person visiting or participating in the Service
                (such as individuals who may receive shared Content from other
                mmeet members).

            <br />

            <p>

                your account, including information submitted from your Google
                account, is accurate and truthful and you have the right to post
                the Content on the Service and grant the license to mmeet above.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                You understand and agree that we may monitor or review any
                Content you post as part of a Service. We may delete any
                Content, in whole or in part, that in our sole judgment violates
                this Agreement or may harm the reputation of the Service.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                When communicating with our customer care representatives, you
                agree to be respectful and kind. If we feel that your behavior
                towards any of our customer care representatives or other
                employees is at any time threatening, harassing, or offensive,
                we reserve the right to immediately terminate your account.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                In consideration for mmeet allowing you to use the Service, you

            <p>10. Purchases.</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                Generally. From time to time, mmeet may offer products and
                services for purchase (&quot;in app purchases&quot;) through the
                App Store, Google Play Store, carrier billing, mmeet direct
                billing or other payment platforms authorized by mmeet. If you
                choose to make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to
                confirm your purchase with the applicable payment provider, and
                your method of payment (be it your card or a third party account
                such as the Google Play Store or App Store (your &quot;Payment
                Method&quot;) will be charged for the in app purchase at the
                prices displayed to you for the service(s) you&apos;ve selected
                as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on
                your payments, and you authorize mmeet or the third party
                account, as applicable, to charge you.
            </p>

            <p>Auto-Renewal; Automatic Card Payment</p>

            <p>
                If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through
                an in app purchase, your Payment Method will continue to be
                billed for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial
                subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent
                subscription period, your subscription will automatically
                continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you
                agreed to when subscribing. Your card payment information will
                be stored and subsequently used for the automatic card payments
                in accordance with the Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
                Objections to a payment already made should be directed to{' '}
                <Link href="contacts">Customer support</Link> if you were billed
                directly by mmeet or the relevant third party account such as
                the App Store. You are also able to object by contacting your
                bank or payment provider, who can provide further information on
                your rights as well as applicable time limits. You may
                unconditionally withdraw your consent to automatic card payments
                at any time by going to Settings on mmeet or the relevant third
                party account, but be advised that you are still obligated to
                pay any outstanding amounts.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will
                need to log in to your third party account (or Settings on
                mmeet, if applicable) and follow the instructions to terminate
                or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted
                your account with us or if you have deleted the mmeet
                application from your device. Deleting your account on mmeet or
                deleting the mmeet application from your device does not
                terminate or cancel your subscription; mmeet will retain all
                funds charged to your Payment Method until you terminate or
                cancel your subscription on mmeet or the third party account, as
                applicable. If you terminate or cancel your subscription, you
                may use your subscription until the end of your then-current
                subscription term, and your subscription will not be renewed
                after your then-current term expires.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additional Terms that apply if you pay mmeet directly with your
                Payment Method. If you pay mmeet directly, mmeet may correct any
                billing errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already
                requested or received payment. If you initiate a chargeback or
                otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, mmeet
                may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion.
            </p>

            <p>
                You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting mmeet
                and going to Settings. If a payment is not successfully settled,
                due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do
                not edit your Payment Method information, terminate or cancel
                your subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected
                amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method,
                as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your
                payment billing dates. In addition, you authorize us to obtain
                updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for
                your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit
                card issuer. The terms of your payment will be based on your
                Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you
                and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other
                provider of your chosen Payment Method.
            </p>

            <p>
                Virtual Items. From time to time, you may be able to purchase or
                earn a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
                revocable license to use &quot;virtual items&quot;, which could
                include virtual products or virtual “coins” or other units that
                are exchangeable within the Service for virtual products
                (collectively, &quot;Virtual Items&quot;). Any Virtual Item
                balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world
                balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a
                measurement of the extent of your license. Virtual Items do not
                incur fees for non-use, however, the license granted to you in
                Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with the terms of
                this Agreement, when mmeet ceases providing the Service or your
                account is otherwise closed or terminated. mmeet, in its sole
                discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to
                access or use Virtual Items and may distribute Virtual Items
                with or without charge. mmeet may manage, regulate, control,
                modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time. mmeet shall have
                no liability to you or any third party in the event that mmeet
                exercises any such rights. Virtual Items may only be redeemed
                through the Service. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL
                ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. The
                provision of Virtual Items for use in the Service is a service
                that commences immediately upon the acceptance of your purchase
                of such Virtual Items. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT mmeet IS NOT
                REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND IN RESPECT OF VIRTUAL ITEMS FOR ANY
                REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER
                COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED,
                WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.
            </p>

            <p>
                Refunds. Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable,
                and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.
                We may make an exception if a refund for a subscription offering
                is requested within fourteen days of the transaction date, or if
                the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.
            </p>

                For subscribers residing in the EU or European Economic Area -

                without stating the reason during the 14 days after the
                subscription begins. Please note that this 14-day period
                commences when the subscription starts.

                Wallet) or mmeet (you can find this on your confirmation email).
                You may also mail or deliver a signed and dated notice which
                states that you, the buyer, are canceling this Agreement, or
                words of similar effect. Please also include the email address
                or mobile number associated with your account along with your
                order number.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you use your right of cancellation (except for purchases made
                through your Apple ID, which Apple controls), we will refund (or
                ask Google to refund) all payments received from you, without
                undue delay and in any case within 14 days of the date when we
                received notice of your decision to cancel the Agreement. We
                shall make such refund using the same means of payment as used
                by you in the initial transaction. In any case, no fees will be
                charged to you as a result of the refund.
            </p>

                If you made a purchase through a payment platform not listed
                above, please request a refund directly from the third-party
                merchant through which you made your purchase.

                You cannot cancel an order for delivery of digital content that
                is not delivered on a physical medium if order processing has
                begun with your explicit prior consent and acknowledgement that
                you will thereby lose your right of cancellation. This applies,
                e.g., to purchases of Virtual Items. That means that such
                purchases are FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.

            <p>15. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver.</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                Except for members residing within the EU or European Economic
                Area and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim
                    arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any
                    alleged breach thereof) or the Service shall be BINDING
                    ARBITRATION administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined
                    Arbitration Rules & Procedures, except as modified by our{' '}
                    <Link href="arbitrationProcedures">
                        Arbitration Procedures
                    </Link>
                    . The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is
                    that either party has the right to bring an individual claim
                    against the other in a small claims court of competent
                    jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding
                    party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims
                    court instead if the claim is within the jurisdiction of the
                    small claims court. If the request to proceed in small
                    claims court is made before an arbitrator has been
                    appointed, the arbitration shall be administratively closed.
                    If the request to proceed in small claims court is made
                    after an arbitrator has been appointed, the arbitrator shall
                    determine whether the dispute should remain in arbitration
                    or instead be decided in small claims court. Such
                    arbitration shall be conducted by written submissions only,
                    unless either you or mmeet elect to invoke the right to an
                    oral hearing before the Arbitrator. But whether you choose
                    arbitration or small claims court, you agree that you will
                    not under any circumstances commence, or maintain, or
                    participate in against the Company any class action, class
                    arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding
                    against mmeet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above
                    arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT
                    TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you
                    and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to
                    small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO
                    PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. If
                    you assert a claim against mmeet outside of small claims
                    court (and mmeet does not request that the claim be moved to
                    small claims court), your rights will be determined by a
                    NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator
                    shall determine all claims and all issues regarding the
                    arbitrability of the dispute. You are entitled to a fair
                    hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can generally
                    grant any relief that a court can, including the ability to
                    hear a dispositive motion (which may include a dispositive
                    motion based upon the parties’ pleadings, as well as a
                    dispositive motion based upon the parties’ pleadings along
                    with the evidence submitted), but you should note that
                    arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more
                    streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.
                    Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may
                    be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For

                    arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of
                    competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration
                    agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any
                    litigation against the Company (except for small-claims
                    court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state
                    courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You hereby
                    irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for
                    such purposes.

            <br />

            <p>
                For members residing in the EU or European Economic Area or
                elsewhere where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law,
                the laws of Texas, U.S.A., excluding Texas’s conflict of laws
                rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to
                this Agreement or the Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                the Arbitration Agreement in Section 15 above shall be governed
                by the Federal Arbitration Act. For the avoidance of doubt, the
                choice of Texas governing law shall not supersede any mandatory
                consumer protection legislation in such jurisdictions.

            <p>17. Venue.</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                Except for members residing in the EU or European Economic Area
                who may bring claims in their country of residence in accordance
                with applicable law and except for claims that may be properly
                brought in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction, all
                claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, to the
                Service, or to your relationship with mmeet that for whatever
                reason are not submitted to arbitration will be litigated
                exclusively in the federal or state courts of Dallas County,
                Texas, U.S.A. You and mmeet consent to the exercise of personal
                jurisdiction of courts in the State of Texas and waive any claim
                that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.
            </p>

            <p>18. Indemnity by You.</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to

                this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement
                shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of the
                Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this
                Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
                provision. You agree that your mmeet account is non-transferable
                and all of your rights to your account and its Content terminate
