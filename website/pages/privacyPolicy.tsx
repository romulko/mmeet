                At mmeet, your privacy is a top priority. Your privacy is at the
                core of the way we design and build the services and products
                you know and love so that you can fully trust them and focus on
                building meaningful connections.

            <br />

            <p>
                We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us
                with your information, and we do not take this lightly.

                <strong>Our commitment to privacy.</strong> We design all of our
                products and services with your privacy in mind. We involve
                experts from various fields, including legal, security,
                engineering, product design, and others, to ensure that our
                decisions are taken with the utmost respect for your privacy.

                <strong>Our commitment to transparency.</strong> Because we use
                many of the same online services you do, we know that
                insufficient information and overly complicated language are
                common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite
                approach: we’re doing our best to write our Privacy Policy and
                related documents in plain language. We actually want you to
                read our policies and understand our privacy practices!

            <p>
                Welcome to mmeet’s Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time
                to read it. We appreciate your trusting us with your
                information, and we intend to keep that trust. This starts with
                ensuring you understand the information we collect, why we
                collect it, how it is used, and your choices regarding your
                information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in
                plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.
                This Privacy Policy applies from September 23, 2022.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>EFFECTIVE DATE: September 23, 2022</p>

            <br />

            <p>1. Where This Privacy Policy Applies</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events, and other
                services we operate under the mmeet brand. For simplicity, we
                refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy.
                To clarify, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all
                applicable services.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a
                service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this
                Privacy Policy -- applies.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>2. Information We Collect</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                It goes without saying we can’t help you develop meaningful
                connections without some information about you, such as basic
                profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We
                also collect information about your use of our services, such as
                access logs, as well as information from third parties, like
                when you access our services through your social media account.
                If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>Information you give us</p>

                    When you participate in surveys, focus groups or market

                    instance if you decide to create and log into your mmeet
                    account via your social media or other account (e.g. Google
                    or Apple).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Information collected when you use our services</p>

            <p>
                When you use our services, this generates technical data about
                which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices
                you use to access our services. See below for more details:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Usage Information. Using the services generates data about
                    your activity on our services, for instance how you use them
                    (e.g., when you logged in, features you’ve been using,
                    actions taken, information shown to you, referring webpages
                    address and ads that you interacted with) and your
                    interactions with other members (e.g., members you connect
                    and interact with).
                </li>
                {/*<li>*/}
                {/*    Device information. We collect information from and about*/}
                {/*    the device(s) you use to access our services, including*/}
                {/*    hardware and software information such as IP address, device*/}
                {/*    ID and type, apps settings and characteristics, app crashes,*/}
                {/*    advertising IDs (which are randomly generated numbers that*/}
                {/*    you can reset by going into your device’ settings),*/}
                {/*    identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies*/}
                {/*    that may uniquely identify a device or browser.*/}
                {/*</li>*/}
            </ul>

            <br />

            <p>3. Cookies and Other Similar Data Collection Technologies</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar
                technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, SDKs) to recognize you
                and/or your device(s). You may read our{' '}
                <Link href="/cookiePolicy">Cookie Policy</Link> for more
                information on why we use them and how you can better control
                their use.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox
                and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a
                website that a user does not want to have his or her online
                activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal
                receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from
                collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all
                browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.
                For this reason, many businesses, including mmeet, do not
                currently respond to DNT signals.

                <li>
                    Comply with applicable laws and regulations: We process your

                    to comply with applicable laws and regulations and evidence
                    our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For

                    retention obligations and to be able to respond to valid
                    access requests from law enforcement. We also keep data
                    evidencing consents members give us and decisions they may
                    have taken to opt-out of a given feature or processing.

                    Consent: If you choose to provide us with information that
                    may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain
                    jurisdictions, such as your sexual orientation, you’re
                    consenting to our processing of that information in
                    accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, we
                    may ask for your consent to collect specific information
                    such as your precise geolocation or use your information for
                    certain specific reasons. In some cases, you may withdraw
                    your consent by adapting your settings (for instance in
                    relation to the collection of our precise geolocation) or by
                    deleting your content (for instance where you entered
                    information in your profile that may be considered “special”
                    or “sensitive”). In any case, you may withdraw your consent
                    at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the
                    end of this Privacy Policy.

            <p>5. How We Share Information</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the
                main sharing of members’ information is, of course, with other
                members. We also share some members’ information with service
                providers and partners who assist us in operating the services
                and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details
                about how your information is shared with others.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    With other members You share information with other members
                    when you voluntarily disclose information on the service
                    (including your public profile). Please be careful with your
                    information and make sure that the content you share is
                    stuff that you’re comfortable being visible. If you choose
                    to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for
                    certain content or information about you, then it will be
                    visible according to your settings. If someone submits a
                    report involving you (such as a claim you violated our Terms
                    Of Use), We may communicate to the reporter actions, if any,
                    we took as a result of their report.

                <li>
                    For corporate transactions We may transfer your information
                    if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a
                    merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring,
                    reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of
                    ownership or control.

                <li>
                    With law enforcement / when required by law We may disclose
                    your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with
                    a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search
                    warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other
                    legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or
                    detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law);
                    or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To enforce legal rights We may also share information: (i)
                    if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or
                    threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal
                    rights and legal rights of our members, business partners or
                    other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements
                    with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other
                    action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other
                    wrongdoing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With your consent or at your request We may ask for your
                    consent to share your information with third parties. In any
                    such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the
                    information. We may use and share non-personal information
                    (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who
                    you are such as device information, general demographics,
                    general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form),
                    as well as personal information in hashed, non-human
                    readable form, under any of the above circumstances. We may
                    combine this information with additional non-personal
                    information or personal information in hashed, non-human
                    readable form collected from other sources. More information

            <p>6. Cross-Border Data Transfers</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                Sharing of information involves cross-border data transfers to
                the United States of America and other jurisdictions that may
                have different laws about data processing. When we transfer
                personal information outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom,
                Switzerland or other countries which data protection laws have
                been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other
                competent governmental body, we use{' '}

                (standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies
                transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy
                and security of your data) or other appropriate transfer
                mechanism.

            <p>7. Your Rights</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                We want you to be in control of your information, so we want to
                remind you of the following options and tools available to you:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Access / Update tools in the service. Tools and account
                    settings can help you access, rectify or remove information
                    that you provided to us and that’s associated with your
                    account directly within the service. If you have any
                    question on those tools and settings, please contact our
                    customer care team for help{' '}
                    <Link href="contacts">here</Link>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Device permissions. Mobile platforms can have permission
                    systems for specific types of device data and notifications,
                    such as phone contacts, pictures, location services, push
                    notifications and advertising identifiers. You can change
                    your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the
                    collection or processing of the corresponding information or
                    the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course,
                    if you do that, certain services may lose functionality.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an app
                    by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for
                    your device. Remember that uninstalling an app does NOT
                    close your account. To close your account, please use the
                    corresponding functionality on the service.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Account closure. You can close your account by using the
                    corresponding functionality directly on the service.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We also want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a
                few key points to remember:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Reviewing your information. Applicable privacy laws may give
                    you the right to review the personal information we keep
                    about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called
                    right of access, right of portability, right to know or
                    variations of those terms). You can exercise this right by
                    updating your data in the mobile app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Updating your information. If you believe that the
                    information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are
                    no longer entitled to use it and want to request its
                    rectification, deletion, object to or restrict its
                    processing, please do it thought mobile app.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For your protection and the protection of all of our members, we
                may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer
                the above requests.
            </p>

            <p>
                Keep in mind, we may reject requests, including if we are unable
                to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or
                if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or
                the privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to
                receive information relating to another member, such as a copy
                of any messages you received from them through our service, the
                other member will have to contact us to provide their written
                consent before the information is released. We may also ask them
                to provide proof of identity before we can answer the request.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to
                object to or restrict the processing of personal information,
                notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our
                service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our
                service if we do not have your date of birth and thus cannot
                ensure that you are 18 years or older.
            </p>

            <p>
                In certain countries, including in the European Economic Area
                and the United Kingdom, you have a right to lodge a complaint
                with the appropriate data protection authority if you have
                concerns about how we process your personal information. You can
                find information about your data protection regulator in the
                European Economic Area{' '}

                    here
                </Link>
                , and in the United Kingdom{' '}
                <Link href="https://ico.org.uk/">here</Link>. The data
                protection authority you can lodge a complaint with may be that
                of your habitual residence, where you work or where an alleged
                infringement took place.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>8. How Long We Retain Your Information</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for
                legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law.
                If you decide to stop using our services, you can close your
                account and your profile will stop being visible to other
                members. After your account is closed, we will delete your
                personal information, as laid out below:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    We delete your data and only keep limited information for
                    specified purposes, as laid out below:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            a) We maintain limited data to comply with legal
                            data retention obligations: in particular, we keep
                            transaction data for 10 years to comply with tax and
                            accounting legal requirements, credit card
                            information for the duration the user may challenge
                            the transaction and “traffic data” / logs for one
                            year to comply with legal data retention
                            obligations. We also keep records of consent members
                            give us for five years to evidence our compliance
                            with applicable law.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            b) We maintain limited information on the basis of
                            our legitimate interest: we keep customer care
                            records and supporting data as well as the imprecise
                            location of download/purchase for 5 years to support
                            our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and
                            enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a
                            claim, information on the existence of past accounts
                            and subscriptions, which we delete three years after
                            the closure of your last account to ensure proper
                            and accurate financial forecasting and reporting,
                            profile data for one year in anticipation of
                            potential litigation, for the establishment,
                            exercise or defence of legal claims, and data
                            necessary to prevent members who were banned from
                            opening a new account, for as long as necessary to
                            ensure the safety and vital interests of our
                            members.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            c) Finally, we maintain information on the basis of
                            our legitimate interest where there is an
                            outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute
                            requiring us to keep information (in particular if
                            we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking
                            us to preserve data (in which case we would need to
                            keep the data to comply with our legal obligations)
