            <ul>
                <li>
                    Overview. Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where
                    a neutral person (the &quot;Arbitrator&quot;) hears and
                    decides the parties’ dispute. Arbitration proceedings are
                    designed to provide parties with a fair hearing in a manner
                    that is faster and less formal than court proceedings. The
                    following procedures (the “Arbitration Procedures”) are
                    applicable to all arbitration proceedings involving you and
                    mmeet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. mmeet is always
                    interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently.
                    So before you commence an arbitration, we suggest that you
                    contact us to explain your complaint, as we may be able to
                    resolve it without the need for arbitration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Administrator. The administrator for the arbitration is
                    JAMS, an organization that is not affiliated with mmeet. The
                    JAMS facilitates, but does not itself conduct, the
                    arbitration. The arbitrator who will hear and decide your
                    dispute will be chosen from the JAMS&apos;s roster of
                    neutral arbitrators. For information on the JAMS, please
                    visit its website, https://www.jamsadr.com. Information
                    about JAMS&apos;s rules and fees for resolving disputes can
                    be found at JAMS’s Streamlined Arbitration Rules &
                    Procedures page,
                    https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Applicable Rules. The arbitration will be governed by JAMS’s
                    Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures (the JAMS Rules),
                    as modified by these Arbitration Procedures. If there is any
                    inconsistency between the JAMS Rules and these Arbitration
                    Procedures, the Arbitration Procedures will control.
                    However, if the Arbitrator determines that strict
                    application of any term of the Arbitration Procedures would
                    result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration (the
                    &quot;Unfair Term&quot;), then the Arbitrator shall have
                    authority to modify the Unfair Term to the extent necessary
                    to ensure a fundamentally fair arbitration that is
                    consistent with these Arbitration Procedures (the
                    &quot;Modified Term&quot;). In determining the substance of
                    a Modified Term, the Arbitrator shall select a term that
                    comes closest to expressing the intention of the Unfair
                    Term.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Commencing an Arbitration. To commence an arbitration
                    against mmeet, you must complete a short form, submit it to
                    JAMS, and send a copy to mmeet at mmeet. To learn more about
                    commencing an arbitration and to obtain a form to institute
                    arbitration, please visit the JAMS website and download the
                    form available at,
                    https://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf.
                    You may represent yourself in the arbitration or have a
                    lawyer (or some other representative) act on your behalf.
                    Upon receipt of an arbitration claim, mmeet may assert any
                    counterclaims it may have against the complaining party.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fees. You are responsible for paying your portion of the
                    fees set forth in the JAMS fee schedule for consumer
                    disputes. mmeet will pay all remaining fees, except to the
                    extent that fees paid by either party may be re-allocated
                    upon order of the Arbitrator following a determination (a)
                    that other party’s claim or counterclaim was filed for
                    purposes of harassment or was frivolous, (b) that the other
                    party engaged in any activities during the course of the
                    arbitration for the purposes of harassment or to cause
                    unnecessary costs or delay, or (c) that re-allocation is
                    permitted by applicable law. If your claim against mmeet is
                    for less than $1,000 and you succeed on the merits, we will
                    pay all fees, subject to the potential re-allocation
                    discussed in the prior sentence. If you believe you cannot
                    afford the JAMS fee, you may apply to JAMS for a fee waiver.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Discovery. Each party may (a) request relevant,
                    non-privileged documents from the other party; and (b)
                    request that the other party provide the particulars of its
                    claims or responses to no more than 5 relevant
                    interrogatories (including subparts). Any such discovery
                    requests must be served on the other party within 10 days
                    after the Arbitrator’s appointment. The responding party
                    shall provide the requesting party with all responsive,
                    non-privileged documents, responses to the requested
                    interrogatories, and/or any objections to the requests
                    within 30 days after receipt of the requests. In the event
                    of an objection to any discovery request, the objecting
                    party shall not be required to provide any documents or
                    interrogatory responses within the scope of the objection
                    until the later of (a) 30 days after the Arbitrator resolves
                    the dispute or (b) a deadline for production determined by
                    the Arbitrator. In the event either party requests that the
                    Arbitrator consider a dispositive motion prior to the
                    expiration of a response deadline set forth in this
                    paragraph, such response deadline shall be extended until 30
                    days following (a) the Arbitrator’s decision on the request
                    to hear the dispositive motion or (b) if the Arbitrator
                    grants the request to hear the dispositive motion, the
                    Arbitrator’s final decision on such dispositive motion.
                    Depositions shall not be permitted, unless agreed to by both
                    parties. Any disputes about discovery or requests for
                    extensions shall be submitted promptly to the Arbitrator for
                    prompt resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or
                    extension request, the Arbitrator shall take into
                    consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the
                    underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort that
                    would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the
                    case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is
                    necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or
                    defense.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Communications with the Arbitrator. Whenever communicating
                    with the Arbitrator, the parties must include each other –
                    for example, by including the other party on a telephone
                    conference call and copying the other party on any written
                    submissions, such as letters or emails. To the extent
                    practicable, conferences with the Arbitrator will take place
                    by telephone conference call or email. Ex parte
                    communications are not permitted with the Arbitrator.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Confidentiality. Upon either party’s request, the Arbitrator
                    will issue an order requiring that confidential information
                    of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in
                    documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in
                    connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce
                    the arbitration award and that any permitted filing of
                    confidential information must be done under seal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Arbitration Hearing. The Parties agree to waive an oral
                    hearing and submit the dispute to the Arbitrator for an
                    Award based on written submissions and other evidence as the
                    Parties may agree, unless a party requests an oral Hearing
                    in writing within 10 days after the Arbitrator’s
                    appointment. The Parties agree that the Arbitrator shall
                    have the authority to consider dispositive motions without
                    an oral evidentiary hearing if it determines that the motion
                    is likely to succeed and will dispose of or narrow the
                    issues in the case. Dispositive motions may be requested
                    under the following circumstances: (a) within 30 days after
                    the Arbitrator’s appointment, a party may request to file a
                    dispositive motion based upon the pleadings; and (b) no
                    later than 30 days prior to the oral evidentiary hearing, a
                    party may request to file a dispositive motion for summary
                    judgment based upon the parties’ pleadings and the evidence
                    submitted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Arbitration Award. The Arbitrator will render a written
                    decision within 30 days after the hearing or, if no hearing
                    was held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental
                    statements are due. The decision must clearly specify the
                    relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the
                    reasons for the award.
